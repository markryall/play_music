# Simple command line utilities for playing music

## somafm

## scrobbling

You need to create your own api key on last.fm to be able to perform scrobbling - the sign up is [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). Once you have this, you will be able to enter the key, secret and then authenticate as a last.fm user.
